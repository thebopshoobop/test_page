  <dt>On Space</dt>
  <dd>Space is big. Really big. You just won’t believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is. I mean you may think it’s a long way down the road to the chemist’s, but that’s just peanuts to space.</dd>
  <dt>On Travelers</dt>
  <dd>Any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still know where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with.</dd>
  <dt>On Timeliness</dt>
  <dd>I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.</dd>
